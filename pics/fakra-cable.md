# Fakra <=> Ethernet Cable

In order to connect to your Tesla, you'll need to build or buy a Fakra <=> Ethernet cable.

If building it yourself, use a Fakra Type Z male plug for easiest connection to a Tesla. Other types can work, but you will need to dremel them to get them to fit properly. See pinout.png (oriented as if you are facing the male end of the cable, which plugs into the car), and other images for connection details.
