Just the washer nozzles that can be heated: 

$25 - 1005404-01-E - Heated washer nozzle assembly - 2x

May not be needed, but it includes a harness and wiring. It could be the same as the one currently installed in the car. If you have wiring conduit running alongside the water hose, you have heated nozzle capability. 

$60 - 1025202-00-C - Windshield washer nozzles with harness and hose 

In this photo you can see the conduit + the hose. Conduit has a connector going into the washer nozzles. So check if your car has it.

Non heated nozzles will only have hose, no wiring
