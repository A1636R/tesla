## Install

Install is simple, remove the existing washer nozzles (clips off at the bottom, then pull the hose out of the connection to remove). And replace with your new harness & hose.

The new harness will plug into your left front wheel well, where the washer fluid reservoir is. You will find a connector not going anywhere near there. This is what your new electronic hose connects to. Mine had a dummy connector plugged into it, you can remove that and plug in the new hose instead.

Part of the new harness will run up behind the front hood

In this photo you can see the conduit + the hose. Conduit has a connector going into the washer nozzles. So check if your car has it.
