# Heated Rear Seats

## Config

```bash

## Parts

I don't really have part numbers for this. You need to find heated rear cushions & backs from a salvage yard or maybe you can ask Tesla nicely.

1005778-00-B - If you want occupancy detection, look for 3 silver parts on the bottom of the cushion. Typically only sold in EU, so you can buy them on ebay. The following photo does not have the detectors.

You can verify if your car is compatible with rear occupancy by checking for 3 wires coming from your seat belts

You should also look for dangling wires under your rear seats, on the driver side. This is what your seat cushion plugs into to get heat.
