## Parts

I don't really have part numbers for this. You need to find heated rear cushions & backs from a salvage yard or maybe you can ask Tesla nicely.

If you want occupancy detection, look for 3 black boxes on the bottom of the cushion.

You can verify if your car is compatible with rear occupancy by checking for 3 wires coming from your seat belts

You should also look for dangling wires under your rear seats, on the driver side. This is what your rear cushion plugs into to get heat. There's another dangling wire for the back rest heat (not pictured)
