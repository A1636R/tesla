## Install

You need a whole new windshield for this install. 

Typically, when you get a chip / crack in your windshield and Tesla replaces it for you, they give you a windshield with HWA (heated wiper area) already installed at the bottom of the shield.

When that's done, you can either ask them to enable the config, or enable it yourself after verifying the connections are plugged in. It's the right side A pillar. If the connector is dangling, simply plug it in.
