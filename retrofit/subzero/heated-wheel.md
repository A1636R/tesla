# Heated steering wheel, > Dec 2014 only

Wiring exists coming from dash to behind the steering column for all vehicles built after Dec 8 2014. For vehicles before this, there are no easy instructions...The MCU sends LIN + PWR to SCCM for heated steering wheel (? accuracy not confirmed)

## Config

```bash
access-internal-dat.pl steeringheat 1
```

## Parts

* $200 - 1036774-00-D - Wheel with heated component, make sure it has the wire hanging out
